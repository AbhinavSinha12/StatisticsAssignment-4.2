Problem Statement 1:
Find the variance for the following set of data representing trees in California (heights in
feet):
3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9

This can be calculated using the below steps
Step 1: 

We need to sum all the available data.

3 + 21 + 98 + 203 + 17 + 9 = 351

Step 2: Now take the square of the number obtained in Step 1.

351 × 351 = 123201

Step 3:
Divide the obtained result in step 2 with the total count of the available items (n =6)

123201 / 6 = 20533.5

Step 4: Square all the number in Step 1 and add them. 

3 × 3 + 21 × 21 + 98 × 98 + 203 × 203 + 17 × 17 + 9 × 9 = 51633

Step 5: Now subtract the obtained result from step 4 with the result step 3.

51633 – 20533.5 = 31,099.5

Step 6: Now final step divide the number in Step 5 by the total item count -1 (n =6)

31099.5 / 5 = 6219.9
